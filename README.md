Note:
To compile the program, please make sure to put "demo_final" directory under the following structure:

home/unpv13e/tcpcliserv/test/demo_final
                                  |- 01.cpp
                                  |- Makefile
                                  |- big_two_cli
                                  |- ...

(The "test" directory should be configured to put "demo_final")
